Spectral CPO model of polycrystalline materials that can: 

- Model lattice rotation, discontinuous DRX, and rotation/continuous DRX.
- Calculate CPO-induced viscous and elastic anisotropies using stress/strain homogenizations.
- Calculate CPO-induced elastic and electromagnetic wave velocities.
- Convert between structure tensors and spectral expansions coefficients.
- Integrate with finite-element codes such as Elmer and FEniCS.
