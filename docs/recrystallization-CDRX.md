# Continous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) 

Polygonization (rotation recrystallization, CDRX) accounts for the division of grains along internal sub-grain boundaries resulting from local strain incompatibilities. 
In effect, CDRX reduces the average grain size upon grain division but does not necessarily change the CPO much ([Alley, 1992](https://doi.org/10.3189/S0022143000003658)). 

Following [GÃ¶dert (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s001610050095), CDRX can be modeled by approximating this effect as a Laplacian diffusive process on $S^2$:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{D} n}{\mathrm{D} t} = \Lambda\nabla^2 n  ,
$$

where $\Lambda$ is the CDRX rate-factor magnitude that depends on temperature, stress, strain-rate, etc. ([Richards et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116718)).

!!! warning "Limited use"

    Notice that this model is currently only relevant to slip-system normals. 
    The model is therefore not yet useful for e.g. olivine. 

### Matrix model 

The corresponding effect on the continuous distribution function is 

$$
\frac{\mathrm{D} n}{\mathrm{D} t} = \Lambda\nabla^2 n 
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\frac{\mathrm{D} {\bf s}}{\mathrm{D} t} = {\bf M_{\mathrm{CDRX}}} \cdot {\bf s} .
$$

### Code example 

```python
import numpy as np
from specfabpy import specfab as sf
# L=8 truncation is sufficient in this case, but larger L allows a very strong fabric to  
#  develop and minimizes the effect that regularization has on low wavenumber modes (l=2,4)
lm, nlm_len = sf.init(8) 

### Velocity gradient tensor experienced by parcel

ugrad = np.diag([0.5, 0.5, -1.0]) # uniaxial compression along z-axis
D = (ugrad+np.transpose(ugrad))/2 # symmetric part (strain rate tensor)
W = (ugrad-np.transpose(ugrad))/2 # anti-symmetric part (spin tensor)

### Numerics 

Nt = 25   # number of time steps
dt = 0.05 # time-step size

### Initial fabric state

nlm = np.zeros((Nt,nlm_len), dtype=np.complex64) # n state vector
nlm[0,0] = 1/np.sqrt(4*np.pi) # normalized isotropic state at t=0

### Euler integration

for tt in np.arange(1,Nt):
    nlm_prev = nlm[tt-1,:] # previous solution
    Lambda = 1             # CDRX rate-factor
    M = Lambda*sf.M_CDRX(nlm) # CDRX operator 
    nlm[tt,:] = nlm_prev + dt*np.matmul(M, nlm_prev) # euler step
    nlm[tt,:] = sf.apply_bounds(nlm[tt,:]) # apply spectral bounds if needed 
```
