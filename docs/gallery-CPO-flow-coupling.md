# Coupling flow and CPO

The coupled evolution of flow and CPO can be solved by joining different components of specfab together with a momentum balance solver (e.g., Stokes solver):

That is, specfab can model:

* [CPO evolution](fabdyn-matrix-model.md) given bulk stress, strain-rate and temperature fields (green piece)
* [Viscous anisotropy](enhancements-strainrate.md) induced by the CPO (orange piece)
* [Bulk anisotropic rheologies](constitutive-viscoplastic.md) given the local viscous anisotropy (blue piece)
