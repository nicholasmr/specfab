Spectral CPO model of polycrystalline materials that can:

- Model lattice rotation, discontinuous DRX, and rotation/continuous DRX.
- Calculate CPO-induced viscous anisotropies using Sachs/Taylor homogenizations.
- Calculate elastic P- and S-wave velocities using Voigt/Reuss homogenizations.
- Provide expressions for forward+inverse orthotropic and transversely isotropic rheologies.
- Convert between structure tensors and spectral expansions coefficients.
- Be integrated with finite-element codes such as Elmer and FEniCS.
